Multivariate time series imputation
---------

- Temporal modeling



Multivariate time series forecasting
---------

- High-dimensional data (One example is [web traffic time series forecasting
](https://www.kaggle.com/c/web-traffic-time-series-forecasting/data) which consists of approximately 145k time series, and the first place solution is available at [https://github.com/Arturus/kaggle-web-traffic](https://github.com/Arturus/kaggle-web-traffic). Another example is using Diffusion Convolutional Recurrent Neural Network (DCRNN) to forecast the traffic of the entire California highway network with 11,160 traffic sensor locations simultaneously, and the Python code is available at [https://github.com/liyaguang/DCRNN](https://github.com/liyaguang/DCRNN).)

- Multi-dimensional data (One excellent example is human mobility flow, it has origin, destination, and time dimensions.)

- Missing data.
